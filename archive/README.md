## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These files represent the development history and contain valuable information. While superseded, they:
- Show project evolution
- Contain details that informed current docs
- Serve as reference for understanding decisions
- May contain useful examples or edge cases

---

## Using Archived Docs

**⚠️ Warning**: Information in archived docs may be outdated.

**Always check current documentation first:**
1. [`QUICKSTART.md`](../QUICKSTART.md) - Quick setup
2. [`DOCS_INDEX.md`](../DOCS_INDEX.md) - Find current docs
3. [`PROJECT_COMPLETE.md`](../PROJECT_COMPLETE.md) - Complete status

**Only refer to archived docs if:**
- You need historical context
- Tracing evolution of a feature
- Current docs reference archived material
- Contributing and want to understand previous approaches

feat: Implement Phase 05 - Network Collapse System

Implements progressive station death mechanics with act-based escalation,
player consensus weight visualization, and critical threshold warnings.

Backend:
- NetworkCollapseScheduler with deterministic death scheduling
- Act-based death rates (slow → accelerating → rapid)
- Player weight calculation and critical threshold detection
- Game time tracking system
- 4 new API endpoints for collapse control
- 12 comprehensive unit tests (all passing)
- State model extensions for collapse tracking

Frontend:
- Death animation system (flicker → disconnect sequence)
- Dead station rendering (grayed out, no connections)
- Player weight visualization panel with color-coded display
- Critical threshold warning (pulsing alert at 30%+)
- Automatic death polling every 2 seconds
- Collapse sequence control (start/stop)
- Real-time weight recalculation

Death Schedule:
- Act III (Days 10-20): ~14 deaths at 1-2/day
- Act IV (Days 20-25): ~17 deaths at 3-5/day
- Act V (Days 25-28): ~16 deaths in rapid succession
- Final state: 3 stations survive for Act VI choice

Integration:
- Narrative trigger fires at Iteration ≥15 OR Witness trust ≥90
- Act progression now persists in PersistentState
- Collapse state tracked in SessionState
- Clean API for future phase integration

Testing:
- 12 unit tests covering all scheduler functionality
- Demo script for interactive testing
- Manual integration testing verified

Documentation:
- PHASE_05_COMPLETE.md - Completion certificate
- PHASE_05_QUICKREF.md - Quick reference guide
- 05_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Full technical docs

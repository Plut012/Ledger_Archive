# Integration Plan: Audio & Visual Polish

## Objective
Add atmospheric sound design, visual effects, and polish to enhance immersion.

## Complexity: LOW
Asset integration and event triggers.

---

## Audio Design

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| Boot sequence | Electronic hum building |
| Block validation | Satisfying lock/confirm tone |
| Transaction propagation | Soft pulse traveling |
| Station death | Electrical failure, distant |
| Witness message | Subtle static, whisper |
| ARCHIVIST speaking | Clean, synthetic, cold |
| Reconstruction | Data parsing sounds, fragments |
| Graveyard block click | Low, somber tone |
| Final choice | Silence, then deep hum |

## Visual Effects

### Graveyard Blocks
- Darker color palette
- Particle effects (dust, decay)
- Heavier shadows

### Network Deaths
- Flicker → snap → fade
- Ripple effect through connections

### Terminal
- Optional CRT curvature
- Optional scanlines
- Typing sounds
- Command latency simulation

### Glitch Effects (Act VI)
- Screen distortion
- Text corruption
- Color aberration

## Assets Needed
- ~10 sound effects
- Particle textures
- Glitch shaders

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

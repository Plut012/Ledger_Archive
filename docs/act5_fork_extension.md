# Act 5 Fork Split Extension - Implementation Notes

## Status: ON HOLD - Design Discussion Required

### Context
We discussed adding an interactive "fork split" mechanic to Act 5 to make it more hands-on, matching the interactivity of Acts 1-4.

### Next Steps Before Implementation
Before proceeding with implementation, we need to discuss and document:

1. **Simplicity measures** - How to keep the fork visualization and interaction minimal
2. **Robustness measures** - How to ensure the mechanic works reliably without edge cases
3. **Specific design decisions** - The exact interaction flow and visual approach

### Placeholder
Once design decisions are finalized, document them here and proceed with implementation.
